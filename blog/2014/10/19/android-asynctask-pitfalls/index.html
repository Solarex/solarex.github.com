	<div class="entry-content"><p><center><img src="/images/android_logo.jpg"/></center></p>


<p>I originally wrote this article when I was (foolishly) still using AsyncTasks. Nowadays I simply consider it a mistake in all cases. As you&rsquo;ll see from the original article, there are a lot of problems with it &ndash; and there are much better solutions.</p>

<p>My preferred alternative these days are combining <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava">RxJava</a> with schedulers. You get the same effect as an <code>AsyncTask</code> with none of the problems, plus you get an awesome framework in addition. I know, recommending a library to solve a problem is irritating, but RxJava is worth looking at for many reasons.</p>

<p>When <code>AsyncTask</code> was introduced to Android, it was labeled as “<a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/05/painless-threading.html">Painless Threading</a>.” Its goal was to make background Threads which could interact with the UI thread easier. It was successful on that count, but it’s not exactly painless – there are a number of cases where <code>AsyncTask</code> is not a silver bullet. It is easy to blindly use <code>AsyncTask</code> without realizing what can go wrong if not handled with care. Below are some of the problems that can arise when using <code>AsyncTask</code> without fully understanding it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>AsyncTask and Rotation</h2>

<p>AsyncTask’s primary goal is to make it easy to run a Thread in the background that can later interact with the UI thread. Therefore the most common use case is to have an <code>AsyncTask</code> run a time-consuming operation that updates a portion of the UI when it’s completed (in <code>AsyncTask.onPostExecute()</code>).</p>

<p>This works great… until you rotate the screen. <strong>When an app is rotated, the entire <code>Activity</code> is destroyed and recreated. When the Activity is restarted, your AsyncTask’s reference to the <code>Activity</code> is invalid, so <code>onPostExecute()</code> will have no effect on the new Activity.</strong> This can be confusing if you are implicitly referencing the current Activity by having AsyncTask as an inner class of the Activity.</p>

<p>The usual solution to this problem is to hold onto a reference to AsyncTask that lasts between configuration changes, which updates the target Activity as it restarts. There are a variety of ways to do this, though they either boil down to using a global holder (such as in the <code>Application</code> object) or passing it through <code>Activity.onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()</code>. For a Fragment-based system, you could use a retained Fragment (via <code>Fragment.setRetainedInstance(true)</code>) to store running AsyncTasks.</p>

<h2>AsyncTasks and the Lifecycle</h2>

<p>Along the same lines as above, it is a misconception to think that just because the Activity that originally spawned the <code>AsyncTask</code> is dead, the <code>AsyncTask</code> is as well. It will continue running on its merry way even if you exit the entire application. <strong>The only way that an <code>AsyncTask</code> finishes early is if it is canceled via <code>AsyncTask.cancel()</code>.</strong></p>

<p>This means that you have to manage the cancellation of AsyncTasks yourself; otherwise you run the risk of bogging down your app with unnecessary background tasks, or of leaking memory. When you know you will no longer need an <code>AsyncTask</code>, be sure to cancel it so that it doesn’t cause any headaches later in the execution of your app.</p>

<h2>Cancelling AsyncTasks</h2>

<p>Suppose you’ve got a search query that runs in an <code>AsyncTask</code>. The user may be able to change the search parameters while the <code>AsyncTask</code> is running, so you call <code>AsyncTask.cancel()</code> and then fire up a new <code>AsyncTask</code> for the next query. <strong>This seems to work… until you check the logs and realize that your <code>AsyncTask</code>s all ran till completion, regardless of whether you called <code>cancel()</code> or not!</strong> This even happens if you pass mayInterruptIfRunning as true – what’s going on?</p>

<p>The problem is that there’s a misconception about what <code>AsyncTask.cancel()</code> actually does. It does not kill the Thread with no regard for the consequences! All it does is set the <code>AsyncTask</code> to a “cancelled” state. <strong>It’s up to you to check whether the AsyncTask has been canceled so that you can halt your operation</strong>. As for mayInterruptIfRunning – all it does is send an <code>interrupt()</code> to the running Thread. In the case that your Thread is uninterruptible, then it won’t stop the Thread at all.There are two simple solutions that cover most situations: Either check <code>AsyncTask.isCancelled()</code> on a regular basis during your long-running operation, or keep your Thread interruptible. Either way, when you call <code>AsyncTask.cancel()</code> these methods should prevent your operation from running longer than necessary.</p>

<p>This advice doesn’t always work, though – what if you’re calling a long-running method that is uninterruptible (such as <code>BitmapFactory.decodeStream()</code>)? The only success I’ve had in this situation is to create a situation which causes an Exception to be thrown (in this case, prematurely closing the stream that BitmapFactory was using). This meant that <code>cancel()</code> alone wouldn’t solve the problem – outside intervention was required.</p>

<h2>Limitations on Concurrent AsyncTasks</h2>

<p>I’m not encouraging people to start hundreds of threads in the background; however, it is worth noting that there are some limitations on the number of <code>AsyncTask</code>s that you can start. The modern <code>AsyncTask</code> is limited to 128 concurrent tasks, with an additional queue of 10 tasks (if supporting Android 1.5, it’s a limit of ten tasks at a time, with a maximum queue of 10 tasks). That means that if you queue up more than 138 tasks before they can complete, your app will crash. Most often I see this problem when people use <code>AsyncTask</code>s to load Bitmaps from the net.</p>

<p>If you are finding yourself running up against these limits, you should start by rethinking your design that calls for so many background threads. Alternatively, you could setup a more intelligent queue for your tasks so that you’re not starting them all at once. If you’re desperate, you can grab a copy of <code>AsyncTask</code> and adjust the pool sizes in the code itself.</p>
