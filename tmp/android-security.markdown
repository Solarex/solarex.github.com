##Android SELinux

[REF](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/security/index.html)
Android seeks to be the most secure and usable operating system for mobile platforms by re-purposing traditional operating system security controls to:

+ Protect user data
+ Protect system resources (including the network)
+ Provide application isolation

To achieve these objectives, Android provides these key security features:

+ Robust security at the OS level through the Linux kernel
+ Mandatory application sandbox for all applications
+ Secure interprocess communication
+ Application signing
+ Application-defined and user-granted permissions
